# Word2Vec_Documents_Comparisons
This repository aims to compare the similarity of three different documents using the word2vec approach. The project starts by applying the word2vec approach from scratch to all three documents. Then, it uses two different approaches to calculate the similarity between the documents.

- Approach 1: Calculates the Euclidean distance between each word in the first document and every word in the second document.
- Approach 2: Calculates the Centroids for each document and then:
  - calculates the Euclidean distance.
  - cosine similarity between the first document and the second document and the first document and the third document.

## Results:
- Approach 1:
